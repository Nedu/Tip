# Tip
# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Chinedum Robert-Maduekwe**


This is my first app ever on any platform. I had no knowledge or experience with Swift prior to doing this project. 

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view using a switch.
- [x] Added a slider to account for multiple people

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenge: Learning the swift language and xcode interface. This was my first time using both of this features and it was quite challenging for me to learn this new features and also integrate my knowledge into building this app.
